                            To empower Nepal&apos;s restaurants with technology that&apos;s as delightful for customers as it is
                            efficient for staff. Every restaurant — whether a single-table eatery or a multi-location chain —
                            deserves world-class tools to delight guests and operate profitably.

                            <p>
                                We spent years working in Nepal&apos;s hospitality industry and saw the same problems repeated:
                                paper tickets piling up in the kitchen, walkie-talkies creating confusion, payment verification
                                taking forever, and no way to track business metrics in real-time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Existing solutions were either built for Western restaurants or ignored Nepal&apos;s unique payment
                                methods, tax requirements, and operational workflows. So we built kkkhane from scratch — designed
                                specifically for how Nepal does business.
